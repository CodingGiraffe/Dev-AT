                <p> Born in Dallas, I moved to Austin, Tx when I was just four years old. I grew up in a suburb named Lake Travis where I attened school from kindergarden to senior year. I graduated at the top of my class and played on the varsity basketball team for three of my four high school years. </p>

                <p>Next, I was off to college at Texas State University in San Marcos, Tx. Here I graduated in four years with a BBA and deans list honors. After college, I moved back to Austin and became a Realtor until the market crash of 2010. It was time for a new adventure.</p>

                <p>In 2011, I was offered a job in Denver, CO at the headquaters of WildBlue Communications, a satellite company. After a couple years an old friend asked me to be apart of his company Evolved Ideas which built websites and offered SEO and PPC ad campaigns. I truly loved living in Colorado. From skiing to fishing and everthing in betweeen, Colorado was a fantastic experience in my life. </p>

                <p>Which brings me to today. I am currently enrolled at Austin Coding Academy to further my knowledge in the tech industry. I know if I use the same hard work and dedication I've used in everything else in my life, I will no doubt reach my goal of becoming a full time developer</p>
